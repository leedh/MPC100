# Midnight Pain Club (MPC) Project

This repository contains codes for functional MRI (fMRI) experiments and preprocessing of the MPC project.
Midnight Pain Club project, in short MPC, is named after [Midnight Scan Club dataset](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30613-X) in that it aims to collect highly sampled fMRI data in the field of pain neuroimaging.
**Two-path experiments** were undertaken. The first path was to collect a large number of sessions data from **single participant** (Longitudinal study). In parallel, the second direction was to collect single session data from **more than a hundred participants** (Cross-sectional study).
